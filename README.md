# HER2-Lite: Lightweight Deep Learning Models for HER2 Scoring from H&E and IHC Images

HER2-Lite is a deep learning-based framework for automated HER2 scoring using histopathological images. This project explores lightweight CNN models that offer high accuracy while remaining suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings such as rural hospitals and mobile labs.The presented models are suitbale for both IHC and H&E histopathogical images.
